# Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development

## [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

Learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, TypeScript, React Native, GitHub Actions and Docker in one go! This course will introduce you to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs. The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, the use of databases for storing the applicationâ€™s data amongst other things.

The course is totally free of charge. You can get a certificate and even the University of Helsinki ECTS credits for free.
